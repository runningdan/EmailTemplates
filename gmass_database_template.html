Hello {first_name},

After scrolling through I saw a few issues on your website ({domain}) that are causing you to lose customers. I thought I would let you know.

I am a web developer located near {city}. Whenever I have some time I like to reach out to local businesses and try to provide some free value/information that will help bring in more revenue.

<b>Here are some issues I found.</b>
<ul>{{ If var("issue_name_1") != "" AND var("issue_name_1") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_1}</u> - {issue_description_1}</li>{{ End If }}{{ If var("issue_name_2") != "" AND var("issue_name_2") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_2}</u> - {issue_description_2}</li>{{ End If }}{{ If var("issue_name_3") != "" AND var("issue_name_3") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_3}</u> - {issue_description_3}</li>{{ End If }}{{ If var("issue_name_4") != "" AND var("issue_name_4") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_4}</u> - {issue_description_4}</li>{{ End If }}{{ If var("issue_name_5") != "" AND var("issue_name_5") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_5}</u> - {issue_description_5}</li>{{ End If }}{{ If var("issue_name_6") != "" AND var("issue_name_6") Then }}<li><u>{issue_name_6}</u> - {issue_description_6}</li>{{ End If }}</ul> I hope this insight helped out. Iâ€™m looking to build two more websites for {industry} in {city}. In the past our websites have generated clients over $65,000/year from a $2k-5k investment.

Email me back if you are interested in converting more customers/optimizing your website.

All the best,
